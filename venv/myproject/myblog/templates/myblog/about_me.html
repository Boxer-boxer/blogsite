          		<p class='p-2'> Hi! </p>
              <p class='p-2'> My name is Jorge! I'm currently 26 years old and I live in Lisbon. There's not much to be said about me other than the fact that I'm trying my best to break into web development. </p>
              <p class='p-2'> This blog is dedicated to my journey from a bottom-tier scrapper who can barely loop a list without crashing a computer to a programming champion! </p>
              <p class='p-2'> I currently work as Training Specialist and graduated as a Social and Organizational Psychologist... Other than that I'm just a regular guy who loves dogs, martial arts, books, videogames, stuff in 8-bits and gets over excited about pizza toppings and snow... and that's about it.  </p>
              <p class='p-2'> On the side bar you'll find my list of objectives for the coming year! 2019-2020 will be stellar years! </p>
              <p class='p-2'> I hope my lackluster presentation doesn't deter you from following my journey! If you want to contact me over something I posted on this blog, feel free to do so at: xxxxxxxxx@xxxxxx.com. I'd love to hear your opinions, tips or corrections! </p>
